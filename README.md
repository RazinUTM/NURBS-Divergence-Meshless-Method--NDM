# NURBS-Divergence-Meshless-Method--NDM
Inspired by the earlier works on MFV and drawing from our experience in MM and coupling NURBS with RPIM, this work proposes an extension of the divergence theorem to meshless methods, with geometry represented by NURBS, termed the NURBS-Divergence-Meshless (NDM) method.
